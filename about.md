![Jacob]({{ site.url }}/assets/jacob.jpg)

I'm a Computer Vision and Machine Learning developer.

I live in Israel, and have an Msc focusing on Computer Vision from Tel Aviv University.

This blog contains a few points in my journey from low level Computer Vision, to classic Machine Learning methods, 
to modern Deep Learning!

If you find the contents here interesting, you might want to check my [github](http://github.com/jacobgil) account for open source projects i've been working on.

The blog was migrated from blogger to jekyll hosted on github.
Since I was writing the posts with markdown anyway, controlling the blog with git is just so much nicer.
