![Jacob]({{ site.url }}/assets/jacob.jpg)

I'm a Computer Vision and Machine Learning developer.

I live in Israel, and have an Msc focusing on Computer Vision from Tel Aviv University.

This blog contains a few points in my journey from low level Computer Vision, to classic Machine Learning methods, 
to modern Deep Learning!

If you find the contents here interesting, you might want to check my [github](http://github.com/jacobgil) account for some projects i've been working on.

The blog was migrated from blogger to jekyll hosted on github.
I started writing the posts in Markdown, and controlling the blog workflow with git is just so much nicer.

Unrelated to computer vision, I'm the co-builder of a [website](http://www.expensesplit.com) for roommate expense splitting.
